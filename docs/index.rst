Aurora Swarm
============

Communication patterns for orchestrating large-scale LLM agent swarms on Aurora.

Aurora Swarm provides an async Python library for coordinating thousands of LLM agent endpoints using common distributed communication patterns — **broadcast**, **scatter-gather**, **tree-reduce**, **blackboard**, and **multi-stage pipelines**. It manages pooled HTTP connections with semaphore-based concurrency control so you can safely drive 1,000–4,000+ agents from a single orchestrator process.

Quick start
-----------

.. code-block:: python

   import asyncio
   from aurora_swarm import AgentPool, parse_hostfile
   from aurora_swarm.patterns.broadcast import broadcast_and_reduce

   async def main():
       endpoints = parse_hostfile("agents.hostfile")
       async with AgentPool(endpoints) as pool:
           result = await broadcast_and_reduce(
               pool,
               prompt="Propose a hypothesis for why X happens.",
               reduce_prompt="Summarize these hypotheses:\n{responses}",
           )
           print(result.text)

   asyncio.run(main())

   * - Pattern
     - Description
   * - **Broadcast**
     - Send the same prompt to every agent and collect all responses.
   * - **Scatter-Gather**
     - Distribute different prompts across agents round-robin and gather results in input order.
   * - **Tree-Reduce**
     - Leaf agents produce answers; supervisors recursively summarize groups.
   * - **Blackboard**
     - Agents collaborate through a shared mutable workspace in iterative rounds until convergence.
   * - **Pipeline**
     - Multi-stage DAG where the output of one stage feeds the next.
